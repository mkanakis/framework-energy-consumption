## Introduction




## Goal of the paper as defined based on the Goals, Questions and Metrics template(GQM): 

**_An analysis of front-end frameworks, for the purpose of evaluation in regards to their energy consumption, from the point of view of software developers, in the context of mobile development._**	


## Results


## Guidelines for experiment replication.


### Web front-end frameworks

Which libraries/frameworks are we comparing?
We included most of the implementations listed in the [RealWorld repo] (https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld). Here we list them, sorted by popularity.

* [React/Redux] (https://github.com/gothinkster/react-redux-realworld-example-app)
* [Angular] (https://github.com/gothinkster/angular-realworld-example-app)
* [Vue] (https://github.com/gothinkster/vue-realworld-example-app)
* [React/MobX] (https://github.com/gothinkster/react-mobx-realworld-example-app)
* [AngularJS] (https://github.com/gothinkster/angularjs-realworld-example-app)
* [Svelte/Sapper] (https://github.com/sveltejs/realworld)
* [Angular + ngrx + nx] (https://github.com/stefanoslig/angular-ngrx-nx-realworld-example-app)
* [ClojureScript + Keechma] (https://github.com/gothinkster/clojurescript-keechma-realworld-example-app)
* [Dojo 2] (https://github.com/gothinkster/dojo2-realworld-example-app)

Once all the repositories have been cloned, put all the folders inside a root folder. 

Please refer each links in order to install everything you need for run all the frameworks. Make sure to run only the commands for install the dependencies, without running the command for run the frameworks.

In order to start all the frameworks, go to each sub-directories containing the repositories and run the following command. 

* React/Redux: 'npm start'


### AndroidRunner


### RStudio
